# Portfolio-Project-using-Power-BI-and-MS-SQL-Server
This Project is done by using Power BI and Microsoft SQL Server.
Initially, Took a dataset on Pizza Sales and calculated the values on MS SQL Server and created a Report based on that Values. 
Opened a particular dataset in Power BI and loaded and applied transformations such as cleaning, filtering, merging, or reshaping the data to prepare it for analysis.
Finally created dashboards.
